# beflash - Concurrent Behat features runner

To install, simply:

`go get github.com/DATA-DOG/beflash`

Run it in your project directory `beflash`

It expects to find behat executable at `./bin/behat` and scans `features/` directory for scenarios to run at the moment.

It is still work in progress - use it at your own discretion!
